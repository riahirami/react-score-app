## Technologies used

### ReactJs

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, it is used to build single-page applications and allows us to create reusable UI components.

### Material ui

React components for faster and easier web development, used for the design.

### i18next

react-i18next is a powerful internationalization framework for React / React Native which is based on i18next. (Learn once â€” translate everywhere)

### TypeScript

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, meaning that it contains all of the functionality of JavaScript and then some. Therefore, any program written in valid JavaScript will also run as expected in TypeScript. In fact, TypeScript compiles simply to plain JavaScript.
TypeScript offers us more control over our code via type annotations, interfaces, and classes.
